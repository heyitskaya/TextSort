Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world
She took the midnight train going anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit, he took the midnight train going anywhere
Singer in a smoky room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they could share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
